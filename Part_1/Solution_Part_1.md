# Ion Identification

## A. Identifying atoms with spectral line:

Our work is easier since we only have to check for hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen

1. A: Oxygen (II), with wavelength in vaccum ~833 Angstroms

2. B: Carbon (II), with wavelength in vaccum ~903 Angstroms

3. C: Hydrogen (I), with wavelength in vaccum ~911 Angstroms

4. D: Oxygen (I), with wavelength in vaccum ~1039 Angstroms

5. E: Nitrogen (II), with wavelength in vaccum ~1085 Angstroms

6. F: Hydrogen (I), with wavelength in vaccum ~1215 Angstroms

7. G: Oxygen (I), with wavelength in vaccum ~1306 Angstroms

8. H: Carbon (I), with wavelength in vaccum ~1329 Angstroms

## B.

1. Lines in C are related since they all belong to Hydrogen's spectrum for other energy transitions.

2. Plunge near 900 Angstroms is caused by limiting line of Lyman series of Hydrogen. The limiting line is explained by setting the final transition state as infinity in tRydberg's formula for Hydrogen.
